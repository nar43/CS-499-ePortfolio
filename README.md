## üèÜ Overview
This repository documents my process of developing my **CS-499 Capstone ePortfolio**, the final project for my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University.  

Creating this professional ePortfolio allowed me to demonstrate my unique technical abilities and personal growth throughout the program. The included artifacts represent my mastery across three key areas of computer science:

- **Software Design and Engineering**  
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**  
- **Databases**

Each artifact showcases how I have improved my earlier projects through structural refinements, performance optimization, and secure design enhancements. Together, these projects illustrate my skills in software development, problem solving, and modern engineering practices while demonstrating strong motivation and organization.

## üß© ePortfolio Planning

### ePortfolio Initial Plan
My initial plan outlined the structure, goals, and artifacts that would be featured in my ePortfolio. It served as a roadmap for selecting artifacts and identifying enhancements needed to demonstrate growth across all three computer science domains.

### ePortfolio Wireframe
The wireframe and planning documents provided the layout and navigation structure for my GitHub Pages ePortfolio. The design ensures an intuitive user experience, easy navigation, and professional presentation.

## üîç Code Review
For each selected artifact, I conducted an **informal code review** to identify areas for improvement and align them with CS-499 outcomes.  

Each review covered:
- **Existing Functionality:** Walkthrough of the current code and its features.  
- **Code Analysis:** Evaluation of structure, logic, efficiency, security, and readability.  
- **Enhancements:** Planned improvements to strengthen functionality and maintainability.
