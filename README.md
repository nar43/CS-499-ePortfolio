## üèÜ Overview  
This repository documents my process of developing my **CS-499 Capstone ePortfolio**, the final project for my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University.  

Creating this professional ePortfolio allowed me to demonstrate my unique technical abilities and personal growth throughout the program. The included artifacts represent my mastery across three key areas of computer science:  

- **Software Design and Engineering**  
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**  
- **Databases**  

Each artifact showcases how I improved my earlier projects through structural refinements, performance optimization, and secure design enhancements. Together, these projects illustrate my skills in software development, problem-solving, and modern engineering practices while demonstrating strong motivation and organization.

## üîç Code Review  
For each selected artifact, I conducted a code review to identify areas for improvement and align them with CS-499 outcomes.  

Each review covered:  
- **Existing Functionality:** Walkthrough of the current code and its features.  
- **Code Analysis:** Evaluation of structure, logic, efficiency, security, and readability.  
- **Enhancements:** Planned improvements to strengthen functionality and maintainability.
